#### Abstract:

Our research group is working on research on cities and transportation. Focusing on subjects such as streets and plazas, stations and cities, wide-area cultural spheres and highways, and cities of various scales, based on basic research based on mathematical methods, actual urban space planning and urban design practices , We aim to develop a large-scale traffic control system, a sharing service such as public transportation, implement multi-scale simulation, and build a basic theory.

#### 1. Urban life studies

　

**Members:** Yuki Oyama, Kyosuke Chikamatsu, Yui Shoji, Eiji Hato

**Abstract:**
After describing the city as a network, we describe people's behavior with a mathematical model, and we are working on empirical analysis using behavioral data and statistical methods. Aiming to gain a better understanding of urban life and behavioral principles, we deal with mobility-activity models, route-choice models, and traffic allocation problems in discrete-choice models and game-theoretic frameworks. We are trying to analyze human behavior using development and ultra-long-term observation data of more than 10 years.

**Abstract:** We would like to reproduce people's lives and behaviors based on a huge amount of behavioral data and urban activity information collected from various sensors, and clarify the real image of Tokyo in 2050. We are trying to develop a theory for normalizing people's life activity logs based on sensor information, and an algorithm for generating, reproducing, and predicting a huge number of life activity choices and their selection results.

##### Total design for disaster prevention and mitigation

**Members:** Yui Shoji, Midori Maeda, Eiji Hato

**Abstract:** In the midst of the simultaneous progress of the weakening of social roles and the shrinking of cities due to the permeation of individual society in the region, I am thinking about the mechanism design of social systems such as disaster evacuation. In addition to describing the phenomenon of information concentration during disasters using a macroscopic dynamic expression such as the Bose-Einstein condensation, we focus on the altruistic/selfish evacuation behavior of individuals, such as why people help others at the expense of themselves. , to elucidate the microscopic structure of time-space-risk perception, action options and period loss, and the mechanism of evacuation. Based on the theory, field surveys and research on the history of urban formation are conducted in real areas, and a total design of disaster prevention and mitigation is being attempted.

Various spatial elements are linked based on the land's topography and unique regional culture, and while people's lives and flows are developed, the power of economy, law, and technology is enormous. I would like to put into practice spatial planning and spatial design in order to inherit the local life and culture in a developmental way.

#### Abstract:

Our research focuses on **Transportation Research with Data Science**, which involves investigating transportation systems and information and communication technology using theoretical and data-driven approaches to achieve a better society. We are particularly interested in emerging technologies such as automated driving, ridesharing, and connected vehicles. Our research topics include developing data-driven estimation methods for the state of transportation systems (such as traffic flow in a road network), building models to understand the behavior of these systems, and implementing control measures to optimize them for the society.

Our educational policy aims to equip students with the necessary skills to understand (or create) mathematical models that abstract real-world phenomena, solve or compute such models, perform statistical analysis of data, develop computer programs, and write logically. We place emphasis on developing a solid understanding of principles and their application to the expression and resolution of real problems.

The principal investigator of this lab is Associate Professor Toru Seo. We are at Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, School of Environment and Society, Tokyo Institute of Technology (also known as Tokyo Tech). We are also affiliated with the Transport Studies Unit of Tokyo Tech.

If you are interested in applying to our lab for the graduate school admission exam etc., please consult with Prof. Seo beforehand to discuss the application process.

#### Research themes

Our lab studies transportation, both vehicular and human, using theory and data based on mathematical and computer/data scientific approaches. Physical theories clearly explain the mechanisms of phenomena and provide guidelines for controlling them. On the other hand, the large amount of data available today provides us with various insights through means such as machine learning. The goal of our lab is to contribute to the realization of better transportation by appropriately combining theory and data, and to conduct interesting research in the process.

#### Traffic state estimation

Automobile traffic plays a vital role in today's society, but its efficiency is being reduced by congestion, a problem that needs to be solved. However, the road network is so vast that no one knows exactly when, where, and to what extent congestion occurs. Therefore, we are developing and verifying traffic state estimation methods that infer the traffic condition of the entire road network based on limited observation data. Furthermore, based on the obtained data and estimation results, applications such as analyzing the nature of traffic and finding the optimal control are also studied. The data are such as GPS on smartphones and car navigation systems and road-side vehicle detectors. We use methodologies such as traffic flow theory, data assimilation, and machine learning.

#### Traffic flow theory

Traffic flow theory is a mathematical concept that describes the collective behavior of automobile vehicles. It is used to simulate traffic flow in road networks and as a basis for traffic control and traffic state estimation. It can also be used to describe the flow of pedestrians and trains. In our lab, we are improving the models and implementing it as a simulation. We use methodologies such as partial differential equations and numerical simulation.

#### Next-gen transportation systems

Next-gen transportation systems such as automated vehicles and ridesharing have various possibilities. Our lab studies the fundamental and mathematical theories for realizing a better society by using these systems. For example, we are dealing with data-driven optimal dispatch control for automated vehicles, matching for ridesharing, and urban transportation system design for these systems. We use methodologies such as mathematical optimization, reinforcement learning, simulation, and data analysis.

#### Post-disaster transportation and humanitarian logistics

Post-disaster transportation and humanitarian logistics require different management from normal situations due to damaged road and communication infrastructures. To design tolerant transportation and logistics networks against infrastructure damages, our lab studies (1) vulnerability assessment and infrastructure development (preparation and mitigation phases) and (2) control of vehicular, human, and relief goods flows and infrastructure restoration (response phase). We use methodologies such as control theory, mathematical optimization, equilibrium analysis, and numerical simulation.
